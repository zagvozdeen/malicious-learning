# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `cmd/main.go` is the Go entrypoint.
- `internal/` holds server packages (`api`, `config`, `db`, `logger`, `store`).
- `src/` contains the Vue app (`src/main.ts`, `src/components/`, `src/pages/`).
- `public/` is for static assets served by Vite.
- `deploy/` contains nginx config; `compose.yaml` defines a local Postgres service.
- `dist/` is generated by Vite during builds.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server for the frontend.
- `make dev` runs the Go server (`GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go run cmd/main.go`).
- `npm run build` builds the frontend into `dist/`.
- `make build` is a wrapper for the frontend build.
- `npm run preview` serves the built frontend locally.
- `go test ./...` runs Go unit tests.
- `docker compose up -d` starts the local Postgres container (uses `.env` values).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue are linted with ESLint; follow 2-space indentation, single quotes, no semicolons, and trailing commas in multiline objects/arrays.
- Vue component filenames should stay in PascalCase (example: `App.vue`).
- Go code should be `gofmt`-formatted; package names remain short and lowercase.
- Use the `@` path alias for frontend imports (maps to `src/`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Go tests live alongside packages and use `*_test.go` filenames.
- Run the full suite with `go test ./...`.
- There is no frontend test runner configured yet; add one only if you introduce UI logic that needs automated coverage.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit messages follow `type: summary` with lowercase types (examples: `feat: ...`, `chore: ...`, `doc: ...`).
- PRs should describe the change, list relevant commands run, and include UI screenshots when visual changes are made.

## Configuration & Secrets
- Runtime configuration is loaded from `.env` via `internal/config` (DB host, port, name, username, password).
- Never commit secrets; document new required variables in README or this file.
